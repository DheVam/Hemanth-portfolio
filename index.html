        This is a home page Home pages are located in the root directory of the
        website. Many home pages act as a virtual directory for a site — they
        provide top-level menus where visitors can go deeper into various areas
        of the site. For instance, a typical website has a homepage with menu
        items like “about,” “contact,” “products,” “services,” “press” or
        “news.” In addition, the home page often serves to orient visitors by
        providing titles, headlines and images and visuals that show what the
        website is about, and in some cases, who owns it and maintains it. One
        of the best examples is the average business website, which has the
        business name in a prominent place, and often features the logo, while
        also showing pictures related to that business, for instance, who works
        there, what the business produces, or what it does in a community. A
        home page is part of the natural way that the Internet has emerged to
        oriented Web users and help them navigate all of the many sites on the
        global network. Share this Term Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Related Terms
