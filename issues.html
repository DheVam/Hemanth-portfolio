      <h1>ERROR</h1>
      <p>
        In human behavior the norms or expectations for behavior or its
        consequences can be derived from the intention of the actor or from the
        expectations of other individuals or from a social grouping or from
        social norms. (See deviance.) Gaffes and faux pas can be labels for
        certain instances of this kind of error. More serious departures from
        social norms carry labels such as misbehavior and labels from the legal
        system, such as misdemeanor and crime. Departures from norms connected
        to religion can have other labels, such as sin. An individual language
        user's deviations from standard language norms in grammar, pronunciation
        and orthography are sometimes referred to as errors. However, in light
        of the role of language usage in everyday social class distinctions,
        many feel that linguistics should restrain itself from such
        prescriptivist judgments to avoid reinforcing dominant class value
        claims about what linguistic forms should and should not be used. One
        may distinguish various kinds of linguistic errors[6] â€“ some, such as
        aphasia or speech disorders, where the user is unable to say what they
        intend to, are generally considered errors, while cases where natural,
        intended speech is non-standard (as in vernacular dialects), are
        considered legitimate speech in scholarly linguistics, but might be
        considered errors in prescriptivist contexts. See also Error analysis
